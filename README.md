# ClustCrypt
SM Zobaed Code of Submission to HPCC 2019

If you want to crate clusters, copy the documents in /ClientEncryptedSearch/data/tmp folder. 
Go to this location: /cloud/cloudserver/utilities and delete everything that is included there. Or, if you want to use my exiting index, and want to cluster that index,  delete only files that are in the /cloud/cloudserver/utilities/clusters directory. Then follow step 7. 

1. Copy all of the files. 
2. There are two diffrent projects. 
3. Open the Encrypted Search Server in your Eclipse IDE. 
4. Run the project and select Retreive uploaded documents. 
5. Open the Client Encrypted search project. 
6. Run the project and select upload.
7. Then go to the earlier project (Encrypted Search Server) and if it closes rerun it. Select Partition Index. 
8. This is how it will create clusters.

The project is overly large. If you face any difficulty running it, please email me: zobaedsakib@gmail.com
